# Artificial-Intelligence---AI-for-decision-making

- This repository contains three projects that showcase the application of artificial intelligence and data science techniques to solve real-world problems.
- Each project is implemented using various machine learning models and tools, demonstrating the complete data science lifecycle from data preparation to model evaluation and deployment.

## Projects
1. Red Wine Quality Prediction
A project focused on predicting the quality of red wines using machine learning models based on physicochemical properties.

2. Cassandra Data Modeling Project
A data engineering project that explores data modeling, querying, and management using Apache Cassandra.

3. Text Classification using Machine Learning Models
A project aimed at classifying text data into different categories using various machine learning models.
