# Red Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting the quality of red wines using a dataset and implementing the full data science process lifecycle. 
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties.

## Project Overview

The red wine industry is growing, and with it comes the challenge of maintaining and certifying product quality. Traditionally, wine quality assessment relies on human tasters, making it subjective, time-consuming, and expensive. 
This project aims to automate the quality assessment process using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset : "winequality-red.csv"

The dataset used in this project contains various physicochemical properties of red wine, such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol concentration. 
These properties are used as features to predict the quality rating of the wine, which serves as the target variable.

## Project Structure

1. **Business Understanding**: 
   - Explains the context of the red wine industry, the challenges in quality certification, and the potential benefits of an automated solution.

2. **Data Understanding**: 
   - Exploration of the dataset, including summary statistics, visualizations, and initial insights into the relationship between features and wine quality.

3. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Preprocessing steps such as handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Modeling**: 
   - Development of machine learning models to predict wine quality. The models used may include Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines.

5. **Evaluation**: 
   - Performance evaluation of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. **Conclusion**: 
   - Final remarks on the model's performance and potential next steps, such as deploying the model for real-time wine quality assessment.
